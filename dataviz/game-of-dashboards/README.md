# One brain, one dashboard, four frameworks

Using four different frameworks, a dashboard for plotting BOLD timecourses from functional MRI data is implemented. So far, it is realised using [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io 'Streamlit') and [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/introduction 'Dash Documentation'). More details available in this [post](http://neurosnippets.com/posts/game-of-dashboards/#post).

To run the dashboards, you need `python` (`3.7`) and the following packages:
* `streamlit` (`0.79.0`);
* `plotly` (`4.14.3`);
* `dash` (`1.19.0`);
* `dash-core-components` (`1.15.0`);
* `dash-html-components` (`1.1.2`);
* `matplotlib` (`3.1.2`);
* `nibabel` (`3.0.0`);
* `numpy` (`1.18.4`).

The code was tested on macOS `10.15.7`.
